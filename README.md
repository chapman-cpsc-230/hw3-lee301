## Description

In this assignment, we had to explain of what the codes do when we run the program, learn about booleans and square roots, and draw shapes using user inputs.

## What I Learned from This

I learned what each code means, about booleans, square roots, and how to draw shapes using user inputs.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
